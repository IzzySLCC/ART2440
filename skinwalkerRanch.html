            In 1995, Bigelow founded the National Institute for Discovery Science to research and advance study of various fringe sciences and paranormal topics, most notably ufology. The organization researched cattle mutilations and black triangle reports, attributing the latter to the military. The institute was disbanded in 2004. 
            In 1996, Bigelow purchased Skinwalker Ranch, a 480-acre cattle ranch located in Utah that some believe is the site of an interdimensional doorway used by alien shapeshifters.
            <br>
            In December 2017, Bigelow was reported by the New York Times to have urged Senator Harry Reid to initiate what became the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, a government study which operated from 2007 to 2012 tasked with the study of UFOs. According to the New York Times, Bigelow said he was “absolutely convinced” that aliens exist and have visited Earth. 
            Terry Sherman got so spooked by the happenings on his new cattle ranch that 18 months after moving his family of four to the property now known by many as “Skinwalker Ranch” in northeastern Utah, he sold the 512-acre parcel away.
            <br>
            He and his wife Gwen shared their chilling experiences with a local reporter in June 1996: They had seen mysterious crop circles, the Shermans said, and UFOs, and the systematic and repeated mutilation of their cattle—in an oddly surgical and bloodless manner. Within three months of the stories publication, Las Vegas real estate magnate and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow bought the property for $200,000.

            “According to Hunt for the Skinwalker, odd objects have been spotted overhead since the first European explorers arrived: In 1776, Franciscan missionary Silvestre Vélez de Escalante wrote about strange fireballs appearing over his campfire in El Rey. And before the Europeans, of course, indigenous peoples occupied the Uinta Basin. Today, “Skinwalker Ranch” abuts the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation of the Ute Tribe.” 
            A good documentary series on the History Channel is called The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch which brings together a bunch of skeptical scientists to run tests or debunk the theories they have heard. What they end up finding is radioactive soil around the areas with the most paranormal activity, weird shit like unidentified craft (helicopters sometimes) flying above when they start digging in the soil or launching things in the air, and power draining from all electrical devices even when fully charged, instantly.  
            <br>
            “On the night of March 12, 1997—after the ranch had been sold off—biochemist Colm Kelleher, working with Bigelow’s National Institute for Discovery Science, claimed to see a large humanoid creature spying on the research team from a tree.” 
            So, is this just a giant lie to make money? The ranch is cut off from the public and the only money it is making is from the television show documenting the strange phenomena that has been occurring far before it. The Uintah basin is a bowl of paranormal activity that attracts UFO enthusiasts everywhere to hear the stories of strange lights in the middle of nowhere and alien abductions.
