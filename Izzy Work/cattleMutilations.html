            Animal/Cattle Mutilation In the mid-1970s, reports of scattered animal mutilations in western and mid-western states concerned many people. The FBI was asked to investigate but was unable to do so because of a lack of jurisdiction (except when such mutilations were found on Indian lands). These files consist of press clippings and correspondence concerning the issues between 1974 and 1978.In ‘74, A letter was presented to Mr. Kelly, Director of the FBI, indicating the strange Nebraskan cattle mutilation in several counties was eerie and looked like a strange “witchcraft cult”, it was mentioned that the Nebraskan county officers were looking into it, and when the cattle were found on native land, the FBI had to get involved. A newspaper article from the Daily Tribune indicated that many UFO sightings near the cattle mutilations have been reported. It also indicated that each of the cattle’s sex organs were removed. 

Antelope and Knox counties have reported numerous UFO sightings. In Minnesota, North and South Dakota, reports of the cattle’s sex organs, lips, ears, udders, and in some instances, the blood completely drained from the cattle. This was determined to be the fault of foxes. Although foxes were thought to be the culprit in Dakota, there was still widespread panic that the FBI had to investigate. The mutilations were occurring in several states such as Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. There were so many UFO sightings, that the FBI could not send in helicopters to investigate in fear of the ranchers shooting at them. 
<br>
The attention was so large, that it was brought to Congress. In Colorada, the reports were that the left ear, left eye, sex organs, and blood were all missing with no footprints or blood anywhere surrounding the animal. There were 130 cases in two years in nine states, which was enough to deter the FBI from investigating further. The strange thing is that there was a “strange helicopter” around every time there was a cattle mutilation, and several reports were made to Senator Haskell within months in Colorado. It is said that the organs were cut out. So, was this Satanic Panic? A bunch of foxes in different states? A creepy helicopter, or UFO’s? These mutilations were all happening in the west, so why is that? In ‘79 there was another FBI report from New Mexico detailing the economic toll the mutilated cattle have put on these states. It was also stated in that report that the reason the FBI dropped the case was because it is not a federal offense to mutilate Cattle. 
<br>
<br>
In ‘76 the FBI had no leads on who was conducting the Colorado and New Mexico mutilations that were plaguing them in the recent months of that year. My question is, why have these mutilations been plaguing the west for only two years? Is it really an animal doing this then? The other options are creepier. 
Information and descriptions of the cattle mutilations can be found in this document: From looking at the descriptions, the pattern is rectum, scrotum, penis, or vagina has been removed. Out of all of them I read, there is usually no track evidence was odd considering how the specific contents that are removed would indicate animals feeding off it or a surgical removal from a person, but there are no tracks found. One of the mutilated cows had numerous coyote tracks and another saw a white helicopter which is odd to put as track evidence. Another interesting pattern is that it is always on the left side that the soft tissues are removed. Is it just a coincidence that all the cattle died on their right side exposing their left half?  
They even did autopsies of the cattle trying to find bacterial infection, there was some evidence to conclude death by infection though, but it was deemed inconclusive.  
<br>
These mutilations were in two articles of national publication, which shows how big this was during the time and how it was negatively affecting ranchers in the west. The rancher’s fears were growing day by day, which lead them to see the FBI as nothing, but a fear mongered.  
In ‘79, a report in Albuquerque was made out to Sergeant O’Dell who went out to investigate the cattle mutilations happening. He reported back that the scrotum and penis were removed with “surgical precision” and that the hair indicated that it had been dropped or bounced there-which was a feature common to the rest of the mutilations. He also reported that the intestines were removed through the hole where the scrotum had been but were not disturbed. If this were an animal, wouldn’t it have eaten it? The cattle’s tongue was not removed but the ears seem to have been beveled with an instrument.  
Some of the mutilations occurred on native land, which could rule out a person committing these acts.  
Officer Valdez, who has been investigating the incidents in New Mexico has hypothesized that the animals are being shot with some type of paralyzing drug and the blood is being drained out with an injection of anti-coagulant.  
The more the FBI and county officers investigated the mutilations, the more evidence they found that these were not animals responsible for this, but someone or something with surgical sharp tools.  
It is important to note that in ‘80, the FBI decided to investigate this phenomenon being a result of extraterrestrial activity.  
There were 15 cattle mutilations on reservations. 
The theories include cults, religious ceremonies, and native rituals. These are all either satanic panic type beat or racist against natives to suggest that they just decided to get crazy and perform these specific mutilations across the west. In the evidence blogs, it even says that there are no tracks, no blood to be found, and no evidence of animals. A person would have to first take the cattle, perform the operations somewhere else, then drop the cattle in a remote location or back where they found it. Why sexual organs and blood? Kinky shit. 
Officer Valdez investigated 90 cattle mutilations and 6 horse ones as well and determined that they were not the work of an animal.

David Perkins, director of the Department of Research at Libre School had been making maps of the Colorado mutilations and pinpointing the hundreds of them. He said none of it made sense. Tom Adams, another researcher, said that unidentified helicopters or aircraft are always spotted before or sometimes after the incident. He also said that aircraft usually are seen without any markings and fly at a higher altitude with abnormal flight patterns that are deemed illegal. 
Tommy Bland who had been studying animal mutilations like these, had been studying UFO activity for 22 years and mutilations for 12, said that these mutilations date back to the 1800’s with different animals and internationally.
