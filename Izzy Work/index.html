        “Half of all Americans and millions more globally believe we are not alone, according to a 2000 ABC poll. 
        While 40 million Americans say they have seen or know someone who has seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO, 
        a growing number believe they have met aliens.” I am a 22-year-old female who has always been fascinated by UFOs 
        or now known as UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). I decided to find evidence by researching this ongoing curiosity 
        and offer you stories, interesting connections to this paranormal phenomenon, and hopefully convince you to look up 
        in the sky and question what goes across it. Aliens are what I am interested in, and I hope that the information 
        I collected gives you a bit more insight into UFOs.

        Do we discredit people’s stories, the thousands of testimonies and the government’s involvement? No, but we cannot ever 
        fully confirm the existence of something that is far above our comprehension. Are they beings from another dimension? 
        The future? Martians? Or Russians?

        Who knows…

        It is up to you to believe that something strange is going on. It is ignorant to think we are the only beings out there 
        and that strange things cannot happen
