            Project Bluebook. What is it? The Air Force program for the investigation of UFOS. 
From 1947 to 1969, a total of 12, 618 sightings were reported to Project BLUE BOOK. Of these 701 remain "Unidentified." The project was headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, whose personnel no longer receive, document, or investigate UFO reports. 
<br>
<br>
The decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation of a report prepared by the University of Colorado entitled, "Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects;" a review of the University of Colorado's report by the National Academy of Sciences; past UFO studies and Air Force experience investigating UFO reports during the 40s, '50s, and '60s. 
<br>
<br>
Although there were 12,616 UFO sightings between ‘47 and ‘69 the Air Force concluded that none of those were evidence of a national security threat or anything extraterrestrial.  
In 1989, the NEW PROJECT BLUE BOOK was a civilian continuation of the original one. This new project has 148 active Pentagon intelligence and NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) employees interested and currently investigating past UFO reports. 
<br>
<br>
Although Project Blue Book proves that the FBI sees no evidence of UFO’s, many Air Force reports were never given to the head director of this project, Mr. Hoover. Some of the requests for the records are completely blocked out. Project BLUEBOOK also reminds us that there were so many sights that the government had to get involved and investigate it. The lack of enthusiasm to investigate the reports shows that there was a lack of evidence to continue Air Force investigation
