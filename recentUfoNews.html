            In the most recent document release from the NSA, there are 10 documents labeled A-J, that document the radar sightings from the Air Force in either 1980 or recently (not sure, does not say the date). The radar reports say “6 unidentified objects flying” but since there is bias, they put on the side (probably balloons), but it was not confirmed, but they also put (UFO).

Official U.S. Navy video of a 2015 UFO encounter, taken aboard a Navy fighter jet from the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, off the eastern seaboard, near the Florida coast. This is the infamous Tic Tac video of an unidentified flying object too fast for a normal aerial craft, which ends up diving into the ocean after a long chase with an Airforce craft.  
The government now recognizes UFO’s to be legitimate and seen as threats to national security. Nobody knows what they are and if they are foreign advanced technology, but at the end of the day, it is a threat. 
Obama also said on a late-night show that the reports were real and that they do not know what the objects are.

Thanks to the COVID relief bill that also stated for all UFO files to be released. 
In 2017, several news organizations revealed the existence of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a U.S. government-funded program that investigated unidentified flying objects between 2007 and 2012. This secret $22 million program, however, was not the first of its kind. Official government UFO studies began in the late 1940s with Project Sign, providing some of the most credible videos of aerial phenomena to date. Within a few years, that program eventually evolved into Project Blue Book, which actively investigated UFO sightings throughout much of the Cold Warr. The 2017 revelation that the U.S. government was actively researching UFOs reignited world interest in UFOs and aliens.
