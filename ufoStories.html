July 1952 
On two separate occasions Air Force F-94s were scrambled over Washington after UFOs were sighted on radar at Andrews and Bolling Air Force bases. The reports of UFOs disappearing or outrunning the Air Force jets cemented the flying saucer craze in the popular imagination. The unusual blips, seen by multiple air traffic controllers, cruised at between 100 to 130 mph before zooming off at incredible speed. At the time The Washington Post ran the banner headline: "'Saucer' Outran Jet, Pilot Reveals."

November 1971 
Sixteen-year-old Ronald Johnson claimed to have seen a glowing object hovering over a specific area close to his family farm in the early evening. When he went to fetch other witnesses, the object had vanished. However, an eerie glowing ring was found where the UFO had been. Another witness corroborated to police the sighting of the strange flying object. In 2017, Britain's Daily Express newspaper reported a U.K.-based scientist had analyzed soil preserved from the site of the sighting, finding it to contain a potentially chemiluminescent organic compound.

October 1975 
On two successive nights servicemembers reported seeing a UFO hovering over Loring Air Force Base. An object described as a cigar-shaped craft was reportedly seen on radar. The CIA has released documents that show a 1975 watch log describing "unidentified helicopter(s) flying out of Canada."

Named for three individuals involved in the sighting, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Colby Landrum—who claimed they were followed by hovering disc with a single fiery thruster as they drove home through dense woods in eastern Texas. When the trio abandoned their car, they felt intense heat generated by the UFO. All three claimed to suffer health problems in the aftermath of the encounter.

January 1981
In the early evening at his farm in the southern Var region of France, Renato Nicolaï, a 55-year-old farmer, saw a saucer-shaped UFO land on his property at about 50 yards. The lead-colored vessel then lifted off from the ground and flew towards a nearby tree line. The case is considered remarkable because of scorch marks left by the machine, documented, and extensively analyzed by French authorities. No definitive explanation for the incident has ever been given, and 31 years later retired French police confirmed to the Var-Martin that they believed the case remained of the utmost importance.

May 1950 
Widely regarded by Ufologists to have produced the most important photographs of a UFO, the McMinnville sighting became famous at the height of the 1950s UFO craze. Paul Trent captured the images on camera after his wife, Evelyn, spotted a slow-moving metal disk while feeding the rabbits on their farm. The images went on to be printed in Life magazine. The pair maintained they had seen a genuine UFO until their deaths, repeating the tale for The Oregonian in 1997.

October 1967 
Multiple witnesses, including pilots, reported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that they had witnessed a UFO with many glowing or flashing lights flying over the Nova Scotia shoreline. A dozen or so witnesses said they saw a glowing orange sphere crash into the water and then slip beneath the surface. No wreckage was ever found, Canada's National Post reported.

April 2013 
An unidentified flying object was seen flying at low altitude across the Rafael Hernandez Airport runway in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The object did not give any warning signals, although it delayed the departure of a commercial flight. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection aircraft captured infrared video of the episode that was supplied to the Scientific Coalition for Ufology (SCU) by a whistleblower. The video shows the vessel travelling without lights, at some instances below tree-top altitude, at speeds close to 100 mph. An analysis of the video was published in a report by the SCU.

November 2004 
U.S. Navy pilot Cmdr. David Fravor recalled seeing "something not from this earth" while commanding a U.S. Navy strike fighter squadron during exercises some 60 to 100 miles off the coast of California. He recounted observing a tic-tac shaped vessel moving at great speed. The UFO was seen by a crew separate from Fravor that tracked the object and filmed it for more than a minute. The footage has now been declassified and published. The case was publicized by The New York Times following the Pentagon's acknowledgement of its Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program, a 21st-century study of UFO sightings.

December 1980 
Between December 26-28, 1980, U.S. Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Bentwaters reported seeing strange lights near Rendlesham forest. The incident, which has been referred to as Britain's Roswell, was never investigated by U.K. authorities. In 2015 Col. Charles Halt, one of the observers, told the BBCC he had recovered statements from radar operators at the base recounting how they had observed a UFO moving too quickly for normal human flight.
